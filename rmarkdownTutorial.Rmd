If we don't see rmarkdown on the File dropdown menu, run below codes in an R script:
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")



we can make headings with #s

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
etc.

we can make the text *italic*, **bold**, or ***bold italic***

we can make a numbered list:

1. list item 1
2. list item 2

we can make bullet points with either - or *

- bullte point with -
* bullet point with *

we can also add links to the document. For example, [here is a link to my github](https://www.github.com/hatamimatt)


we can use both python and R in this rmarkdown files, a simple example of it would be:

```{r}
# R code
r_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(r_vec)
```



```{python}
# Python chunk
import numpy as np
py_vec = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(py_vec.mean())
```
